# The style, run as a binary rather than as a dependency.
#
# A dependency is not available to every repository - the regulator
# depends on several of them, so the arrow only goes one way - and the
# binary needs none: it reads the workspace it is run in, and
# `lint-exemptions.json` beside this file is where a departure goes.
#
# `--fix <command>` names a program that proposes fixes for findings the
# style has guidance for. The linter judges what comes back.
# Pinned by rev, and it has to be. Unpinned, this fetched whatever the
# linter's main happened to be when CI ran - so this repository could go
# red without anyone touching it, and the rule set moved three times in
# one afternoon. A gate that moves under you is not a gate.
