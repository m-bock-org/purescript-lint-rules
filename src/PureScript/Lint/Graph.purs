-- ## Context
--
-- A small directed-graph module with just the operations this linter's
-- rules actually need - deliberately generic, knowing nothing about
-- CSTs, call graphs, or linting. Extracted (2026-08-28) when
-- `PureScript.Lint.Rules.Nesting.MaxCallStackDepth` needed strongly-connected components:
-- a `Map k (Set k)` and an inline walk had been fine while the only
-- operation was "longest path", but SCC computation is a real algorithm
-- with real subtlety, and that is worth naming and isolating rather
-- than burying inside a rule.
--
-- `longestPath` counts *edges*, and treats an edge back into a node
-- already on the current path as free. That rule matters more than it
-- looks: charging a full hop for a self-call produced three immediate
-- false positives when this measure was first written
-- (`SameConstructorArm`'s `reconstructsConfiguredCtor` recursing through
-- `ExprParens`, among others). Re-entering something you are already
-- tracing adds nothing new to understand.
--
-- `condense` exists for the same reason one size up. Mutual recursion -
-- a recursive-descent AST walker being the canonical case - produces
-- genuinely long simple paths through a densely connected component,
-- but path length through a cycle is not a measure of how hard the code
-- is to follow: you read such a group as a set of cases that call back
-- into each other, not as a chain to trace end to end. Collapsing each
-- component to one node before measuring makes "how deep is this chain"
-- mean what it is supposed to mean, and is the exact generalisation of
-- the self-call rule above.
--
-- `componentsOf` uses Kosaraju rather than Tarjan - two straightforward
-- passes (finish-order on the forward graph, then reachability on the
-- reversed one) instead of one pass with an explicit lowlink stack.
-- Slower asymptotically by a constant, and much easier to read and to
-- convince yourself is correct, which is the right trade at the sizes a
-- single module's call graph reaches.
